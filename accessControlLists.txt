##ACL = Access Control List
*With ACLs, we can give selected users rwx permissions to selected files in your directory.
*This provides a second level of discretionary access control via a method that supports overriding of standard ugo/rwx permissions.
*ACLs supposed on ext4 and XFS FSs and Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)
*Mount appropriate FS with the ACL option

###Display current ACLs of a File

  \#getfacl <file> 


###Modify ACLs of a File

  \# setfacl [switch] [u or g]:<user or group> <path-to-dir-or-file>

 |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
 | -b (--remove-all)  | Removes all ACL entries, retains stand. ugo/rwx permissions |
 | -k                 | Deletes defaul ACL entries                                  |
 | -m                 | Modifies ACLs of a file, normally w/ a specific user or grp |
 | -n (--mask)        | Omits the recalculation of the mask entry                   |
 | -R                 | Applies changes recursively                                 |
 | -x                 | Removes a specific ACL entry                                |


  e.g.: '-m' for modify, and u: to indicate user (in this case user is 'joe')
  \#setfacl -m u:joe:rwx <path-to-dir-or-file>
