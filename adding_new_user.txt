1) Add user & passwd
  ~Vi Passwd~

  # vipw
  ...yank & paste a regular user & change the appropriate fields (UID, group, home folder, etc)

  ...no need to run 'vipw -s' as prompted since we can run the next command ('passwd')

  # passwd <newuser>


2) Add Group
  ~Vi group~

  # vigr
  ...yank & paste & change appropriate things

  We need to actually run this 'vigr -s' command as prompted, unlike the 'vipw -s' command

  # vigr -s
  ...yank & paste & change group name
